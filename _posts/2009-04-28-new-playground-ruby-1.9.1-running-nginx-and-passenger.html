title: 'New Playground: Ruby 1.9.1 running Nginx and passenger'
---

<p>
Last week I got some time to try out Phusion's new Nginx-module. So I decided to try out it's Ruby 1.9 compatibilty, to test my own projects wether they are Ruby 1.9.1 compliant or not.
</p>

<p>
I installed it on a fresh Ubuntu 9.04 RC1 Image into my virtual Box, and everything seems to work good yet.
</p>
<p>
So here is my Install log:

Then choose option 1: "Yes, download, compile and install Nginx for me. (recommended)"

<script src="http://gist.github.com/239766.js?file=gistfile5.txt"></script>
<p>
and insert:
</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/239766.js?file=gistfile7.txt"></script>

<p>
Et voil√°, open your browser and and see an new Rails App. Opening the environment page you can see that everything is running under Ruby 1.9.1.
