title: Defining Functions dynamically in Javascript
---

While playing with some javascript and think about how o create a simple OR mapper for JS client databases, I was in need for defining functions dynamically in in JS.
<br />
As far as I know there is no common build in function to do something like this. From Ruby you might know the <code>define_method</code>-method. I tried to build something similar in JS. So this is what I got:
<br /><br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/367684.js?file=gistfile1.js"></script>
<br />
Feel free to tell me if this is crap or hot,<br />
Cheers
<br /><br />
