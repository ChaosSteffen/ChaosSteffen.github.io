title: Change TextMate Tabs with Two Finger Swipe on Magic Mouse
---

<p>Yesterday I bought me an Apple Magic Mouse and the feature of using gestures for navigation in Safari an other apps really thrilled me.</p>
<p>So I wanted to use the Left/Right Swipe in TextMate to change my current file tab.</p>
<p>What I found was Bryan Schuetz&#8217; tutorial on how to setup <a href="http://wcrawford.org/2008/02/28/everytime-i-think-about-you-i-touch-my-cell/">Multiclutch</a> on Snow Leopard. <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/11/02/how-to-enable-expose-and-spaces-for-the-magic-mouse/">Here</a></p>
<p>So go through the tutorial and you can configure gestures by application context.</p>

<p>So drop me a comment if you have your own productivity improving gestures.</p>
