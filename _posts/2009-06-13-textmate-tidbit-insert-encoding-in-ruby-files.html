title: 'TextMate tidbit: insert encoding in ruby files'
---

<p>Want to insert an encoding comment into your ruby code?</p>

<p>Do it TextMate style and create a snippet: </p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/129324.js"></script>

<p>I know this is very static but I had not much time and decided for the simplest solution.
I tried to read the actual encoding of the file you are inserting in, but always got "US-ASCII" insted of "UTF-8". So if you know better tweet me.</p>
