title: 'New Side Project: Big Boy, Small World'
---

Some weeks ago I started a new side project called: Big Boy, Small World, my personal (german speaking) motorbike blog.

In 2010 I started riding bikes and getting my license and so this year I got me my first bike, a BMW F650GS. After a season start in March and some day trips around Berlin and my hometown Potsdam, I've been to Croatia and some other Balkan countries shortly. All this are thing did and will write about in this blog.

So I hope you enjoy reading my thoughts and journals on <a href="http://bigboysmallworld.com">Big Boy, Small World</a>.
